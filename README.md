# SureLearn

--------------------------------

Learning ought to be accessible and freely available for everyone. The best and only way to do this is if learners can become effective learners, **independently**, and they must be able to do this in an automated manner. This is what SureLearn attempts to do.

## How it works

-------------------------------------------

- It first requests what material the user would like to learn, be it a passage of text, some audio or any video. The user uploads the material.
- It then processes the material using custom machine learning models, analyze the content, and then active learning techniques kick in.
- An auto-generated summary and collection of important points are shown for the user so that they may actively recall all important things about the material that they just studied. 
- Then, their active recall is tested using the two section AI smart quiz. Questions regarding the core points of the material are auto-generated and the user can take them in a fun, game-show like manner. The first section is dedicated to active recall and truly forces the user to remember and comprehend the material, thus making sure the material sticks to memory.
- The next section generates MCQs to test even harder more remote concepts from the memory. The smart testing system keeps track of which questions the user is having difficulty in, and which questions he or she has a thorough grip on, and balances the questions so as to ensure complete learning.  Some fun design truly makes these quizzes enjoyable.
